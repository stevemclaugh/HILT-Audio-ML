## 2.2 NBC chime search with ATTK


[*<< Back to 2.1*](2.1.md) \| [*Forward to 2.3 >>*](2.3.md)


 Download the NBC Radio D-Day radio collection (37.5 hours, 513 MB) [here](http://www.stephenmclaughlin.net/HILT/audio_corpora/NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast.zip), or using `wget`, then unzip it:

```
wget http://www.stephenmclaughlin.net/HILT/audio_corpora/NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast.zip
unzip NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast.zip
```


Open a terminal window in Jupyter and run the following command to update the Python module `attk`, short for Audio Tagging Toolkit.

```
pip install -U git+git://github.com/hipstas/audio-tagging-toolkit/
```


Create 4 new directories like so.

```
cd /home/sharedfolder
mkdir models NBC_DDay_Subset NBC_Chimes NBC_Not_Chimes
```

Open `sharedfolder/NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast` on your desktop. Choose around 10, more or less at random, and move them into `NBC_DDay_Subset`.


### Tagging Chimes

Open one of the recordings in `NBC_DDay_Subset` in Sonic Visualiser. In the toolbar, select "Pane > Add Spectrogram > [filename]: All Channels Mixed" (or just press the `G` key). A spectrogram of your audio will appear at the bottom of the window.

To adjust zoom, use the up and down arrows or scroll using your mouse. To the right of the spectrogram, in the second dropdown menu next to "Bins," change the option "Linear" to "Log."

To move through the recording, use your left and right arrow keys or scroll sideways with your mouse. Here is a typical example of speech audio.

Scroll to the end of the file and see if you can identify the NBC chime sequence by eye. It should look something like this.

Next we'll apply a tag that identifies this segment of audio. In the toolbar, choose "Layer > Add New Regions Layer."

The Draw tool in the upper right should be highlighted automatically. To make it easier to see our work, click the dropdown menu next to "Plot Type" and choose "Segmentation."

Click and drag (left to right) in the waveform pane to select just the chime segment.

In the toolbar, select "File > Export Annotation Layer" and enter a name for your annotation file. For convenience, I recommend using the name of the audio file, using the extension ".csv" instead of ".mp3."

Open the CSV file in a text editor. It should look something like this: one line with three values separated by commas. The first number is the starting time of our tagged segment, in seconds. The last number is the duration of our tag. The second value, "1," is a numeric class identifier.

Repeat this process, collecting tags for five or ten chime sequences. Quit Sonic Visualiser after working on each file.

### Extracting Chime Audio

Create a new Python notebook in Jupyter.

- Now call the `excerpt_class.excerpt_class(..., ..., ..., ...)` function for each of the files you tagged. Here's an example for a file called "CBD-440606_NBC1945-HVKaltenborn.mp3":

```
from attk import excerpt_class

media_path = "/home/sharedfolder/sample_audio/CBD-440606_NBC1945-HVKaltenborn.mp3"

csv_path = "/home/sharedfolder/sample_audio/CBD-440606_NBC1945-HVKaltenborn.csv"

out_dir = "/home/sharedfolder/NBC_Chimes/"

excerpt_class.excerpt_class(media_path, csv_path, out_dir, class_to_excerpt=1)


```


### Extracting Non-Chime Audio

- We also need examples of non-chime audio in order to train our classifier, so let's choose some clips at random. The random_tag.random_tag() script in Audio Tagging Toolkit will handle the details. Create a new cell and enter the following, executing the `random_tag.random_tag(..., ..., ..., ..., ...)` for each file in `NBC_DDay_Subset`.

```
from attk import random_tag

out_dir = '/home/sharedfolder/NBC_Not_Chimes'

media_path = '/home/sharedfolder/NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast/CBD-440607_NBC0015-RoyShieldOrchestra.mp3'

random_tag.random_tag(media_path, out_dir, clip_secs=5 , num_tags=3, extract=True)
```

- Once you've generated a set of random audio segments, you'll need to make sure they don't include any chime audio by mistake. Open VLC Media Player and drag your random files into the playlist window.

Now listen to the set. If a clip contains chimes, locate it in the `sharedfolder` directory and delete it.


Create a new Jupyter cell and enter the following commands. Run the cell to train your model.

```
import os
from pyAudioAnalysis import audioTrainTest as aT

os.chdir('/home/sharedfolder/')

aT.featureAndTrain(['NBC_Not_Chimes','NBC_Chimes'], 1.0, 1.0, aT.shortTermWindow, aT.shortTermStep, "svm", "models/svm_NBC_chimes", False)

```

Create a new cell and run the following command to convert an NBC recording from MP3 to WAV.

```
!ffmpeg -i /home/sharedfolder/NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast/CBD-440606_NBC0300-NewsandMusic.mp3 /home/sharedfolder/NBC_DDay_Complete_Broadcast/CBD-440606_NBC0300-NewsandMusic.wav
```

Finally, run the following to apply your classifier.

```
from pyAudioAnalysis import audioSegmentation as aS

wav_path = '/home/sharedfolder/NBC_DDay_News_Clips/CBD-440606_NBC0330-News.wav'

classifier_model_path = '/home/sharedfolder/models/svm_NBC_noise'

output, classesAll, acc, CM = aS.mtFileClassification(wav_path, classifier_model_path, "svm")

output
```

Create a quick plot of your results like so:

```
import pandas as pd
%matplotlib inline

pd.Series(output).plot()
```
